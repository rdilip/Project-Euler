# Project-Euler

This package contains Rohit's solution code for Project Euler problems, and will be updated as I get bored. They're mostly in Python and C, though there might be a few in Cython.

There is absolutely no organization or structure to my files. I will try to start adding in comments to discuss the algorithm I use, not for your benefit, but because I can't read my own code a few months after I write it more often than not. 

If you want to copy paste this code into your computer, hit a button, then watch as the answer dings out and get some sense of moral accomplishment, go ahead and spoil the Project Euler problems for yourself. Have fun.
